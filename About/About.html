				<p class="fs-5 fst-italic lh-base"> In 2022, we started with a vision - to make a million homes beautiful. Back then, our catalogue featured designs. Yet, when our customers shared photographs of their homes, we saw they were remarkably distinct. The same table, the same chair was used differently by different people. This told us something. People want their homes to be unique. We also realized that people are a lot happier creating things than they are buying things. We are a creative, imaginative, expressive species. And our homes are just one of the many canvases we have at our disposal. </p>
				<p class="fs-5 fst-italic lh-base"> Today, we understand that we're here not just to sell well-designed products. We're here to help you create spaces that mirror who you are. At , we want you to discover the joy of creating. Starting with your home. We want you to think of the setting up of a space as an energizing, creative pursuit. To breathe life into empty rooms with your ideas. To take a few square feet of nothing, and transform it into something beautiful. </p>
